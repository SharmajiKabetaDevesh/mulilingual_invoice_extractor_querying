Humans have expanded the capabilities of how a LLM interacts and interprets by transforming 
from text to images or PDFs from English to any other language such as Hindi or Marathi.

So, by making use of Google Gemini I have created a small Multi-lingual Invoice Extractor, 
that takes an Invoice, and we can query or ask question suitable to the Invoice.

In the broader thinking it has better applications like specific data collection from Invoices 
such collection GST number, products sold, beneficiary name etc.


You can get started with this app by following these steps: 
1) Clone the repo
2) Create a virtual environment using "python -m venv venv"
3) Activate the venv using "source venv/Scripts/activate"
4) Install all libraries using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
5) Create a dotenv file and store your Google Gemini Api Key.
6) Go to the terminal and hit "streamlit run app.py".
7) Yup !!! Its running
